# Nintendo Switch Button Prompts for Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy

For the Steam version of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy.
Replaces Xbox prompts with Nintendo Switch / Nintendo Switch 2 prompts. Keyboard prompts are not affected when no controller is used.

### Content
 - "NintendoSwitch_MOD": Nintendo Switch prompts. Drag its "PWAAT_Data" folder to where the game was installed.
 - "Original_BACKUP": Xbox prompts. Only use this folder if you want to revert changes.

### Install Path
…\steamapps\common\Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy

If you don't know where you installed it, locate the Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy game in your Steam library and click on its settings (gear icon) → Manage → Browse Local Files.

### Important
You may need to change the button configuration in the Steam controller settings, as the prompts correspond to the Nintendo Switch / Nintendo Switch 2 button layout.
For example, I have enabled (in the general Steam options) “Settings → Controller → Use Nintendo button layout”, in addition to having the X and Y buttons reversed in the controller settings for Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy.
